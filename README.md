# Team Retrospective Analysis
## Main Challenge of the project
- The most challenging part of the project was getting started, with the team discussing the tech-stack, how to abide by the constraints given in the assignment and some preference differences between the members, but as soon as we worked out these issues and actual work started, it all went smoothly.
- These disscussions covered different ideas regarding which technologies to use and how to divide the tasks fairly. Aditionally, there was a diagreement between the members on the general style of the website, but again, this was worked out quickly.
## Merge Conflict Resolution
- The approach we followed meant that we all wrote our data in a single file (team.ts). This meant that encountering a merge conflict was inevitable. Such thing happened when one of our members updated the placeholder data used with their real info.
- Fortunately, the impact this had on the work was minimal, and we managed to resolve this quickly with the instructions given in the assignement. The steps we took were simple: merging the latest develop branch into the feature branch, manually resolving the code conflicts, committing the resolution, and
pushing the fix, which was at the end just a simple change in the format. This experience emphasised the importance of clear communication among teammates.
## Importance of Pull Request
- Pull request is an invaluable tool that facilitates collaborative coding. It helped us communicate progress, changes and issues easily and efficiently. For this project, with the given constraint that each member must review two pull requests from the other members, this helped us stay up to date with the latest features and aspects of the project.
